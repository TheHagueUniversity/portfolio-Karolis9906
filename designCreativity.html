          <p>This was one of our first assignments for Design and creativity class. The challenge was to draw the story of my life. During this challange we learned how to structurise the content from most relevant to least relevant, furthermore, we have learned the most basic design rule 3-30-300.</p>

          <p>This assignment was to make a poster of our trip to Austria in which we visited Ars electronica festival. This assignment helped me to further develop my skills of sketching and structurising information.</p>

          <p>This assignment was an introduction to creative thinking technique called "How Might We". In this case the challange was to draw a few ideas of the question "HMW spice up waiting time during travel"? I decided to spice it up in the bad way and this is what I came up with.</p>

          <p>This assignment introduced me to another creative technique which forces you to exagerate your main idea. Initialy my idea was to create a digital drawing station and after I exagerated, it became a digital drawing room. Here you can see my visual depiction of this whole exageration process.</p>
