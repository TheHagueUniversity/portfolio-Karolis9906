          <p>After quick brainstorm I decided to go for something more interesting than just a box with my skills and advantages writen on it. The plan was to create something more dificult with methaphorycal meaning behind it that at the same time would showcase my creativity and craftsmenship.</p>

          <p>I came up with the idea of creating a Trojan horse which would represent me. The dangerous army inside capable of destroying cities perfectly portrays my skills and my ability to deal with any task given to me.</p>
