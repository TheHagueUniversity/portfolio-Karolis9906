        <P>My first interaction with programing was in a course "Programing bootcamp" where we started learning creative programing with the platform "Processing". We had 5 days of the bootcamp in which we were learning a new skill every day and doing a small project after the lecture. In the evening we would present those projects and get feedback on our progress.</P>
